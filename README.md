# Simple Electron-React

A minimal electron & react starter project

Inspired by this guide:

<https://www.codementor.io/randyfindley/how-to-build-an-electron-app-using-create-react-app-and-electron-builder-ss1k0sfer>

Working from this code to use craco instead of rescript:

<https://github.com/wwlib/cra-craco-electron-example>

`yarn dev` launches the project in dev mode

## Features

* Just the normal `create react-app` project. No redux or typescript or whatever.

* import from `electron`, `fs`, etc. as normal, no need to use `window.require()`

* React devtools installed in electron when running dev
